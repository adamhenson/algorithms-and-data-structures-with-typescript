# Algorithms and Data Structures with TypeScript

The goal of this project is to help bridge the gap between textbook computer science concepts and the world of modern programming. It provides examples implementing fundamental algorithms and data structures in TypeScript.

Each directory within the `src` directory provides source code, tests and brief documentation explaining the concept, and how its implemented. The build outputs files in ES module format (otherwise known as "ESM" or "ECMAScript modules" or "JavaScript modules" or "JS modules")

#### Install

```bash
npm run install
```

#### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Test

```bash
npm run test
```

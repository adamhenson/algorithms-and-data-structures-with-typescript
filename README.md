# Algorithms and Data Structures with TypeScript

The goal of this project is to help bridge the gap between textbook computer science concepts and the world of modern programming. It provides examples implementing fundamental algorithms and data structures in TypeScript.

Each directory within the `src` directory provides source code, tests and brief documentation explaining the concept, and how its implemented. The build outputs files in ES module format (otherwise known as "ESM" or "ECMAScript modules" or "JavaScript modules" or "JS modules"). Examples are documented to an extent that illustrates implementation of the concept but not necessarily proper API documentation as this is not a published meant to be consumed.

# Polynomial Time Complexity

**Syntax:** O(_n_<sup><i>c</i></sup>)

> A polynomial algorithm is represented by O(_n_<sup><i>c</i></sup>), An algorithm is said to be of polynomial-time if its running time is upper bounded by a polynomial expression in the size of the input for the algorithm, O(_n_<sup><i>c</i></sup>) for c > 1.

"Polynomial" time complexity is more like a category of forms including <a href="../quadratic-time-complexity/README.md#quadratic-time-complexity">"quadratic" (O(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>))</a>, cubic (O(<i>n</i><sup>3</sup>)), and so on.

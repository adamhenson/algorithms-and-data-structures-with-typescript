# Singly Linked List

> A linked list is a linear data structure similar to an array. However, unlike arrays, elements are not stored in a particular memory location or index. Rather each element is a separate object that contains a pointer or a link to the next object in that list.

> Each element (commonly called nodes) contains two items: the data stored and a link to the next node. The data can be any valid data type.

# Data Structures

> Data structures are one of the foundational parts of computer science. When we discuss the runtime of various algorithms, we assume the data is stored in an appropriate structure that allows it to be handled efficiently. Which structure is best depends on the type of data and how it will be accessed.

- Do we need random access, or is sequential access suffient?
- Will we always append data when writing, or do we need to be able to insert values as well?
- Are duplicate values allowed?
- Do we prefer the lowest possible access time or a strict upper bound on how long a given operation can take?

The answers to each of these questions play a role in how the data should be stored.

# Non-Linear Data Structures

> Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called **non-linear data structures**. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. Non-linear data structures are not easy to implement in comparison to linear data structure. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.
